{\sffamily\normalsize{\color{sciorange} BURST SORT}}\vspace{1mm}\\
\footnotesize 
Burst sort partitions the input strings into growable but
limited-sized buckets that are afterwards sorted using an auxiliary
sorting algorithm, such as multikey Quicksort. Unlike many
distribution sorts, Burst sort reads the input sequentially in order
to avoid cache misses.  The partitioning limits the input length for
the auxialiary sort and can thus improve its cache-efficiency as
well.\\

Burst sort uses a special data structure, \emph{burst trie}, to store
the buckets and maintain their order. The burst trie is a special kind
of trie whose leaf nodes are growable buckets containing pointers to
the suffixes of the inserted strings while the path from the root to
the leaf node via single-character edges represents the prefix of the
strings just as with a regular trie.\\

A new operation, \emph{burst}, is needed when a full bucket is already
at the maximum capacity and a new string is being inserted into
it. Burst creates a new bucket for each character in the alphabet and
redistributes the suffixes in the bursting bucket into them.\\
