{\sffamily\normalsize{\color{sciorange} BURSTSORT}}\vspace{1mm}\\
\footnotesize Burstsort partitions the input strings into growable but
limited-sized buckets that are afterwards sorted using an auxiliary
sorting algorithm. Unlike many distribution sorts, burstsort reads the
input sequentially in order to avoid cache misses.  The partitioning
limits the input length for the auxialiary sort and can thus improve
its cache-efficiency as well. Burstsort's worst case complexity
depends on the implementation details.\\

Burstsort uses \emph{burst trie} to store the buckets and maintain
their order. This data structure is a trie whose leaf nodes are
growable buckets containing pointers to the suffixes of the inserted
strings while the path from the root to the leaf node via
single-character edges represents the prefix of the strings just as
with a regular trie.\\

A new operation, \emph{burst}, is needed when a full bucket is already
at the maximum capacity and a new string is being inserted into
it. Burst creates a new bucket for each character in the alphabet and
redistributes the suffixes in the bursting bucket into them.\\

Our implementation uses a fixed alphabet of 256 symbols, a maximum
bucket size of 32768 strings, and uses in-place multikey quicksort to
sort the buckets.
