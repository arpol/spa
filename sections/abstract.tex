Comparison-based sorting is one of the most mature subfields of CS research.
However, the more well-known of such algorithms have been designed with the
expectation that the objects they sort can be compared in constant time.
When used to sort objects that require linear-time comparison operations,
such as strings, they perform a lot of wasteful work that leads to suboptimal
performance. For maximum efficiency, \emph{string sorting algorithms} are
needed.\\

We have implemented a family of three different string sorting algorithms in
Python and compared their performance against Python's native Timsort~\cite{p2002} using
four different datasets with two variants each.\\
