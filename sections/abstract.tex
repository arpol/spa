Comparison-based sorting is one of the most mature subfields of CS research.
However, the more well-known of such algorithms have been designed with the
expectation that the objects they sort can be compared in constant time.
When used to sort objects that require linear-time comparison operations,
such as strings, they perform a lot of wasteful work that leads to suboptimal
performance.  For maximum efficiency, \emph{string sorting algorithms} are
needed.

We have implemented a family of three different string sorting algorithms in
Python and compared their performance against Python's native Timsort using
a variety of different datasets.
% TODO: add reference to Timsort, discuss something about the results here
