{\sffamily\normalsize{\color{sciorange} QUICKSORT}}\vspace{1mm}\\
\footnotesize 
String quicksort operates by recursively partioning the list of strings corresponding to their lexicographical order compared to the pivot string. It sorts strings in time $O(L(R) + n \log n)$.\\ 

Good pivot selection reduces the maximum depth of the recursion tree. For quicksort we selected the pivot as the median of the first, the last, and the middle string in the list.\\

Ternary quicksort partitions the strings based on whole string comparison. Resulting sets are:
    
\begin{itemize}
    \item Equal to the pivot
    \item Lexicographically smaller than the pivot
    \item Lexicographically larger than the pivot
\end{itemize}

Multikey quicksort partitions using single character comparison, an extra partition for strings with the currently compared character being their last is created.\\

Both algorithms recursively partition the strings until each partition contains only one string. The strings are returned in the reverse order of recursion resulting in a sorted array of strings.
