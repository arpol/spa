The timing test data consisted of the PROTEINS, DNA and ENGLISH datasets from the Pizza\&Chili Corpus, in addition to a set of URLs from Ranjan Sinha's ref1 data ref2 for his original Burstsort paper. \\

A 100MB and a 200MB sample of each dataset was used. The ENGLISH datasets were not used as-is, but with each word split on its own line, in order to make the algorithms sort individual words and not entire lines. The statistics file documents some stringological properties of these datasets.
